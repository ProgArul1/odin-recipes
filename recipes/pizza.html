     <p1>Pizza mozzarella is one of the most easiest and tastiest pizza ever,with a lots of cheese and a less of topping,Here are the ingredients and the steps for making delicious pizza mozarella</p1>

     <ul>
        <li>Whole purpose flour</li>
        <li>Mozarella cheese</li>
        <li>baking soda</li>
        <li>warm water</li>
        <li>sugar</li>
        <li>pizza sauce</li>
        <li>cheese</li>
        <li>yeast</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
     </ul>

     <ol>
        <li>Note: If you don't want to make your own dough, you can buy a ball of pizza dough at the grocery store, and skip to step 6.</li>
        <li>Check with a grownup, and wash your hands before you begin.</li>
        <li>Combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water in the small bowl, and let it sit until the yeast is foamy on top (about 5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil in the larger bowl.</li>
        <li>Once the mixture in the small bowl is foamy, add it to the larger bowl and knead it with your hands. (Don't be afraid to get messy. It's fun!)</li>
        <li>If dough is really sticky, add more flour, a few tablespoons at a time, until the dough is just slightly sticky.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough ball on a floured surface until it's smooth and you can roll it.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough until it's 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. You can use a rolling pin or just stretch it with your hands. Remember, it doesn't have to be perfectly round. All shapes of pizza are tasty!</li>
        <li>Put the rolled-out dough on a baking sheet and top with sauce, cheese, and toppings.</li>
        <li>Using the oven mitts, put the pizza into the oven and bake for 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Have a grownup take the pizza out of the oven, and let it cool off a bit. (Take it from me, this pizza could really burn your tongue!) While you wait, clean up the kitchen, especially if you made a mess with the flour.</li>
        <li>Use a knife or pizza cutter to slice the pizza, and serve it up!</li>
